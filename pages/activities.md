Philip Short, former BBC correspondent and author of a major biography of Mao Zedong, spoke about his latest book about Pol Pot. Recent Cambodian history is closely intertwined with Vietnamese events, so this is a topic of great concern for students of contemporary Vietnam. March 21, 2005. Co-sponsored by the Center for the Study of Force and Diplomacy.

On March 21, 2005, Philip Short, former foreign correspondent for The Times (London), The Economist, the BBC, and author of Mao: A Life and Pol Pot: The History of a Nightmare, presented a talk on the complex factors that led to the horrific brutality of the Pol Pot years in Cambodia during which more than a million Cambodians were executed or died from starvation.

Mr. Short examined the fusion of Marxism and Buddhism in the context of Cambodian culture that, he argues, informed the worldview of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge and that in part accounts for their rise to power. The talk included analyses of the influence of French colonialism as well as Cambodia's relationship with the United States, China, and Vietnam. Mr. Short discussed the roles of key figures including Pol Pot, Norodom Sihanouk, and Richard Nixon. Mr. Short traced the journey of thought and action that led from a utopian ideal for purity and egalitarianism and an appreciation for a cultural heritage enshrined in the temples of Angkor Wat to a sordid history of cultural paranoia, the abolition of money, the forced evacuation of huge numbers of people from the cities, and a three and a half year reign of unimaginable brutality. Pol Pot left behind, Mr. Short argued, the unenviable legacy of the creation of the first slave state in modern times.

This talk was co-sponsored by the Center for Vietnamese Philosophy, Culture, and Society and the Center for Force and Diplomacy at Temple University.

A talk and slide presentation by Le Anh Tu Packard, macroeconomist and frequent consultant to the Vietnamese government.

On January 25, 2005, Le Anh Tu Packard, consultant to the World Bank and chief technical consultant to the Vietnamese Ministry of Finance on the reform of State Owned Enterprises, presented a talk on the gender dimensions of economic reform in Vietnam to the Center for Vietnamese Philosophy, Culture, and Society.

The talk examined the question why Vietnam is an interesting case study of the intersection of gender and economic reform, issues of globalization, the status of women, cultural views of gender equality and inequality, the effects of Doi Moi reforms and foreign policy initiatives, policy issues, positive and negative outcomes, social welfare, access to credit, and prospects for the future.

The gender and macroeconomics research supporting Le Anh Tu Packard's work was commissioned by the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) and will be published as a UNRISD Occasional Paper.
