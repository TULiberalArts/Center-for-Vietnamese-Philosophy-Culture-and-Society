## Vietnamese Language Courses
To register for Vietnamese language courses, students will need to contact the Critical Languages Department to determine which section would be most appropriate. If you are interested in enrolling in one of our Vietnamese language courses, please contact the Critical Languages secretary, Ms. Pam Smallwood at [poppy@temple.edu](mailto:poppy@temple.edu).

### Topics In World History (VietnameseVoices)
Dr. Quinn-Judge's course, Vietnamese Voices: An Introduction to Vietnamese Culture and History through Literature, is taught in English.

**Vietnamese Voices: An Introduction to Vietnamese Culture and History through Literature**
This course introduces students to Vietnamese culture and history by means of a direct encounter with Vietnamese writing. Lectures and background readings provide the context for the interpretation of the poetry, prose and memoirs that we read. The emphasis will be placed on understanding the cultural significance of these works, rather than on literary criticism. Readings follow the chronological development of Vietnamese literature and philosophy, and are guided by five major themes:

- Who Are the Vietnamese People?
- Vietnamese Philosophy and World View
- Development of the Language
- Development of National Consciousness
- The Culture of War

Among the works we read are the narrative poem, The Tale of Kieu by Nguyen Dieu; the poetry of Ho Xuan Huong, an earthy 18th-19th century poetess; and the satirical novel about French colonialism, Dumb Luck. We also read one of the most-acclaimed novels about the Vietnam War, The Sorrow of War , by Bao Ninh.

For further information on the course please contact Dr. Quinn-Judge at [quinnjud@temple.edu](mailto:quinnjud@temple.edu).

### History of Vietnam
This course will be taught in Spring 2007 by Dr.  Nguyen, Dieu T. The History of Vietnam emphasizes cultural, social, and economic factors, tracing Vietnamese history from its mythological origins to the 21st century. Topics include indigenous social formations, the period of Chinese domination, the rise of independent Vietnamese dynasties, the French colonial era, the Vietnamese Revolution, and the three Indochina Wars, including the Vietnam Conflict in the 20th century. It will close with consideration of life under the current Socialist Republic of Vietnam.
