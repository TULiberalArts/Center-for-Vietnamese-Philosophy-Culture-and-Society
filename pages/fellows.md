"My academic research began with the early political career of Ho Chi Minh, which involved a transnational examination of the early communist movement and Comintern; now I am studying the evolution of the concept of a ‘Third Way’ in Vietnamese politics, from the perspective of the Saigon political class and urban anti-war movement as well, as the Hanoi politburo. In an earlier life I worked as a volunteer in Southeast Asia, and as a free-lance journalist in Bangkok and Moscow."

Dr. Quinn-Judge is a highly accomplished scholar of Vietnamese history and culture. Dr. Quinn-Judge has received international recognition for her scholarly work on Vietnam, including her highly-regarded book, Ho Chi Minh: The Missing Years (1919-1941), and essays on such topics as the history of women in 20th-century Vietnamese politics.  Dr. Quinn-Judge, who is fluent in Vietnamese, spent two years in Vietnam working with a medical voluntary agency and she has made numerous subsequent visits to Vietnam.  She has also served as a correspondent on Soviet- Asian affairs for the Far Eastern Economic Review and has contributed to other publications such as the Guardian (London). Dr. Quinn-Judge received her Ph.D. from the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London and she was Research Coordinator of the Cold War Studies Programme in the International History Department at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

![Gregg Drinkwater]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Gregg Drinkwater.png){:.img-right}
**_Gregg Drinkwater_** is a PhD Candidate at the University of Colorado Boulder. Gregg’s research explores how gay and lesbian Jews transformed the landscape of liberal Judaism in the United States in the post-World War II era. By creating gay synagogues in the 1970s and asserting public gay Jewish identities, gay and lesbian Jews contributed to shifting the boundaries of normative sexual and gender roles within liberal American Judaism. These gay Jewish innovators paved the way for the ordination of gay and lesbian rabbis, the widespread adoption of ritual and liturgical innovations rooted in gay and lesbian experiences, and rapid shifts in Jewish perceptions of homosexuality. The Feinstein Center summer fellowship will support a research trip to New York City where Drinkwater will visit the archive at New York’s LGBT Community Center and conduct interviews with founding members of New York’s gay synagogue, as well as gay and lesbian Jews active in other grassroots gay Jewish groups in the 1970s and early 1980s.
