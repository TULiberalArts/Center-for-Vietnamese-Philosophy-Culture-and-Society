**[_Dr. Nguyễn Thị Điểu_](mailto:dieunguy@temple.edu)**<br>
**_Associate Professor of History_**<br>

**Research and Teaching Interests:**
World History, Southeast Asian, Vietnamese History.

**Personal Statement:**
In my research as in my teaching, I have been motivated by the desire to understand, on the one hand, the natural environment, and on the other hand, humanity, linked inextricably by their interactions. Born in Vietnam, during the war known as "the American War" or "the Vietnam War," its histories, cultures, and environment are part of my identity as a historian. My early writing resulted from the combination of all the above factors. My present research has focused on an analysis of the fabric of Vietnamese national identity manifested through multiple identifiers. On this long journey, I have begun work on a general history of Vietnam while examining Vietnam's ancient past through the lenses of varied fields such as archaeology, anthropology, and epistemology, for a capstone monograph on the formation of Vietnamese national identity.

**Representative Publications:**
Culture and Customs of Vietnam (with Mark McLeod, Greenwood, 2001), The Mekong River and the Struggle for Indochina: Water, War, and Peace (Praeger, 1999), "European Reconquest and Neo-Colonialism in Southeast Asia," in Loyd Lee, ed., World War II in Asia and the Pacific and the Post-War World, vol. 2, 1998, "State versus Indigenous Peoples: The Impact of Hydraulic Projects on Indigenous Peoples of Asia," Journal of World History 7:1 (March 1996).

**_PhD and University Fellow, Department of Anthropology_**<br>

I am a doctoral candidate in the Department of Anthropology with a specialization in Linguistic Anthropology. As an anthropologist, I believe that understanding the complexity of the world's languages is as important as knowing how the ecosystem works. My primary interests are the Austronesian-speaking people of Vietnam: the Cham, Chru, Ede, Raglai and Jarai, who reflect the incredible intersections of mainland and maritime culture. While modernity and globalization continue at an extraordinary pace throughout Southeast Asia, I explore their relationships to language socialization, attrition, and endangerment within this region of the world. I hold a master's degree in Bilingual Multicultural Education/TESOL from Southern Connecticut State University, where I also earned my bachelor's degree (summa cum laude) in anthropology with minors in Asian studies and psychology. My previous experiences include fieldwork in the Dominican Republic, research on Drifters in San Francisco, and teaching English in both Shaoxing, China and the Ho Chi Minh City University of Education in Vietnam.

**_Visiting Fullbright Scholar, 2006-2007_**<br>

Dr. Trần Hàn Giang, former Director of the Institute of Family and Gender Studies of the Vietnamese Academy of Social Sciences, spent the 2006-7 academic year at Temple as a Fulbright scholar. She is a historian who specializes in the study of gender relations throughout Vietnamese history. The strongest academic influence in her career came from her mentors at the University of Tokyo, where she studied with the "mother of Japanese women's studies", Hiroko Hara, and the well-known historian of Vietnam, Moto Furuta. Her dissertation concerns Vietnamese gender relations in the French colonial period. During her stay in the United States, Dr. Tran carried out research among the Vietnamese community about gender relations in South Vietnam, in the period from 1954 to 1975.

**_Associate Professor, Department of Anthropology_**<br>

Lu Zhang is an assistant professor of sociology at Temple University.  Her areas of specialization include globalization, labor and social movements, and the political economy of development in East Asia, especially China. She is currently working on a book project on the conditions, subjectivity and collective actions of Chinese autoworkers. This work explores how global capitalism, national state institutions and socialist legacies, and shop-floor labor activism have interacted in complex ways to produce the specific labor relations and dynamics of labor unrest in the Chinese automobile industry. It is based on twenty months fieldwork and around 300 in-depth interviews in seven automobile factories in six Chinese cities. 

Zhang has started a new research project that explores the causes, processes, and impacts of capital relocation within China (from coastal to inland regions) as well as out of China to the new low-cost sites such as Vietnam in the global electronics industry. This comparative case study follows the geographical relocations of two electronics multinationals from the same eastern coastal region of China under the pressure of rising (labor) costs. While both companies have opted to move their manufacturing bases to both inland China and to Vietnam, the difference in their positions in global production networks, technological intensity, recruitment strategies and workers profiles on one hand, and the variations in local governments incentives and strategies towards foreign investments, local labor markets conditions and human capital investment, and local communities and cultures on the other hand, have led to varied workplace relations and labor regimes in the new production sites. By comparing the empirical evidence from China with Vietnam based on site visits and interviews, we are ready to gain some insights into the sustainable economic and social development strategies of central and local governments in (post-socialist) developing countries, and how these interact with the “labor” factor in the context of globalization and capital mobility.

"My academic research began with the early political career of Ho Chi Minh, which involved a transnational examination of the early communist movement and Comintern; now I am studying the evolution of the concept of a ‘Third Way’ in Vietnamese politics, from the perspective of the Saigon political class and urban anti-war movement as well, as the Hanoi politburo. In an earlier life I worked as a volunteer in Southeast Asia, and as a free-lance journalist in Bangkok and Moscow."

Dr. Quinn-Judge is a highly accomplished scholar of Vietnamese history and culture. Dr. Quinn-Judge has received international recognition for her scholarly work on Vietnam, including her highly-regarded book, Ho Chi Minh: The Missing Years (1919-1941), and essays on such topics as the history of women in 20th-century Vietnamese politics.  Dr. Quinn-Judge, who is fluent in Vietnamese, spent two years in Vietnam working with a medical voluntary agency and she has made numerous subsequent visits to Vietnam.  She has also served as a correspondent on Soviet- Asian affairs for the Far Eastern Economic Review and has contributed to other publications such as the Guardian (London).
